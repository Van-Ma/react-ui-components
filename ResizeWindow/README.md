# Resize Window Component

This component is part of a responsive layout that adjusts the width of a container based on the user's input, and displays a navigation menu with different layouts for mobile and desktop devices. The component includes a resizable panel, a hamburger menu for mobile view, and dynamic font resizing. The purpose is to test dynamic sizing with a simulated "windows screen" using a container.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout**: The component adapts its layout based on the container size. It displays a hamburger menu on mobile devices and a horizontal navigation bar on desktop.
- **Resizable Container**: The container can be resized horizontally by dragging the panel, which adjusts the width of the header.
- **Hamburger Menu**: On mobile screens, a hamburger menu appears, which can be toggled to show or hide navigation links.
- **Dynamic Font Resizing**: The font size of navigation links adjusts automatically based on the container width.
- **Smooth Transitions**: The hamburger menu and resizing behaviors are smooth, providing a polished user experience.
